// Tinkers Pipes.

An Idea and concept brought out by the lack of a pipe system unconnected to a large tech based mod.  Not useful when just simple pipes 
called for. 

Plans to include:

Fluid Pipes: Crafted in Tinkers Benches(wood/stone/etc), or cast on the casting table (metals). Will carry various amounts of liquids per   
  tick, depending on materials. Some materials will burn up if hot fluids are piped thru them (wood/paper for example). Which is normally a
  bad thing. But could also be used as a safety valve of sorts to prevent lava for example from flowing in the wrong place.
  
Item Pipes: Same as fluid pipes. Crafted in Benchs/casting table, will allow diff rates of items (and diff stack sizes) to flow thru them 
  Depending on materials used.
  
Valves (on/off/extract) For both fluid and Items. Just a simple valve that will stop the flow of items/fluid so you can work on pipes,  
  They can also be used as restrictor pipes, if the materials used to make the valve have a lesser flow rate than the pipes either side.

A simple water pump, pumps water from the world, into the pipe system. Store in in a Tinker Tank! Will not pump Lava or other fluids. Just water
  (Ranged pumps for 1.10+ is what I suggest for that).  Again, material used to craft it, relates to speed/flow. Might be powered by RF.
  Might be a pulsing Redstone signal.. not made up my mind yet. A pump + Hopper clock is most likely. (or something other Redstone clock)

RF (Forge based energy Pipes), Pipes are possible, but not in the first plans.

A buildcraft compatible wrench, is possible. But I might just use an open hand, or a stick. Hmm Tinkers Wrench...

No other blocks, ores, machines, tools, fancey gadgets will be added to this mod. Simple Straight forward Pipes.
It will use exisiting Metals/materials in the pack, as Tinkers does.

Please note: The pipes will be cast/made in the tinkers benches/table, but WILL NOT use any modifiers whatsoever.

Just using Tinkers as a base, so that I dont have to create a bunch of metals/materials myself.
